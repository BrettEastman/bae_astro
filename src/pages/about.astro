        As concert curator, he is currently co-producing a concert series
        with Jessie Nucho featuring music for flute and electronics
        literally and conceptually inspired by different forms of feedback.
        The first concert “In Response” was presented January 2020 and
        focused on the physical and emotional effects of feedback in dialog.
        In July 2021, they presented the second concert “Self vs. Other”
        which explored anxiety and feelings of isolation in the
        shelter-in-place life. In 2019, Brett composed for a concert he
        co-curated with the ensemble Slow Wave, featuring new music for
        viola, clarinet, and piano. In 2018, he curated and produced a
        concert titled “Punk in Times of War” which featured Messiaen’s
        Quatuor pour la fin du Temps, Nick Vasallo’s When the War Began, and
        Eastman’s MISMA, composed for the concert. He did sound design for
        and co-wrote (with Jon Raskin) the score for the feature-length
        film, “The Murder of Hi Good,” by filmmaker Lee Lorenzo Lynch.
