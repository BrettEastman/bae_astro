        The Murder of Hi Good is a true-crime revisionist western shot on
        35mm, Super 16mm, Super 8mm and digital video. Set in Northern
        California in 1870, the film details the eventual murder of
        Californiaâ€™s most notorious Indian hunter, Hiram Good. Created over
        a seven year period by filmmaker Lee Lynch and co-written by art
        critic Doug Harvey, the film features a diverse set of performers
        including Los Angeles based artists, western re-enactors, and
        regional American Indians.
