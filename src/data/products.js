    description:
      "Internal/External (2023) for solo flute and interactive electronics explores the boundary between inner and outer worlds. In “Internal,” the performer’s pulse shapes live electronic textures; in “External,” environmental sounds and feedback are captured, transformed, and reintroduced. Using a phonetic cryptogram and text on self and planet, the work reflects on feedback between body, sound, and environment.",

    name: "Paraphrase",
    description:
      "Paraphrase for viola, bass clarinet, and piano unfolds in three movements, each a five-minute exploration of connected themes and bold contrasts. Drawing on sources from Liszt to 90s sludge-core band Noothgrush—and echoes of the composer’s own works—it reimagines and expands its inspirations. The trio performs with the intensity and freedom of a rock band, embracing space, distortion, and expression.",

    name: "La Musique",
    description:
      "LA MUSIQUE for flute and alto flute draws from Charles Baudelaire’s poem of the same name. Using a cryptogram that translates French text into pitch, rhythm, and aspirated sound, the work transforms language into music. Layered with melodic renditions of the spoken poem and a recurring lyrical theme, it mirrors the poem’s structure through shifting textures, timbres, and parallel musical form.",

    description:
      "MAINFRAME for string quartet explores distorted symmetry and the evolution or decay of reflection. Across seven movements and 23 mosaic-like sections (11+1+11), moments recur in altered or reversed forms—sometimes recognizable, sometimes not. Centered on an 11-tone sequence, the work’s unity of form, rhythm, and pitch creates a precise yet shifting architecture of sound and memory.",
